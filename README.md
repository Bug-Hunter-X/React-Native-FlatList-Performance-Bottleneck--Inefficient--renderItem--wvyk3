This repository demonstrates a common performance issue in React Native's FlatList component when dealing with large datasets and complex item rendering. The `inefficientFlatList.js` file showcases the problematic implementation, leading to slow scrolling and dropped frames. The solution, presented in `optimizedFlatList.js`, highlights key improvements such as a properly implemented `keyExtractor` and optimized rendering logic within the `renderItem` function.  This improved version demonstrates significantly better performance with minimal visual changes.
