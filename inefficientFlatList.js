In React Native, when using FlatList or SectionList with a large dataset and complex components, you might encounter performance issues or unexpected behavior.  One common, yet subtle, problem is failing to optimize the `renderItem` function, specifically, improperly handling key extraction and item rendering logic.  For instance, if the `renderItem` function performs complex calculations or renders unnecessary components within each item, it can lead to dropped frames and sluggish scrolling.
